  <div id="div1" class="container">
    <p>This div uses the first example as its animation. It gains a background color of black, then switches to red. Once the animation finishes, it abruptly goes back to its initial state of black.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="div2" class="container">
    <p>This div uses the second example as its animation. As you can see, we can be more flexible by using this since we are not limited to a start and end point; we can set other properties in between.</p>
  </div>

  <div id = "div3" class="container">
    <p>This div shows how we can use animations to create a smooth, looped animation by making the starting and ending properties the same.</p>
  </div>
