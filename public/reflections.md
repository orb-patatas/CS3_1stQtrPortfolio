# End of Quarter Reflection
# CANDELARIA, Ruisse Oebree M. | 9 - Sodium | 19 September 2025

## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **Output methods** - Though these methods were quite different from C++ and I barely remember anything from Python, I still found them quite easy to understand and use. I was able to figure out how and when to use them after a few exercises.
2. **Conditional Statements / Operator** - These statements were really similar to C++, except the ternary operator, so I was able to utilize them with ease. For the ternary operator, I wasn't familiar with it beforehand, but it's easy to do and I like its simplicity. Overall, all these statements are easy to integrate into my code.
3. **Arithmetic Operators** - These operators are literally like the ones in C++, which makes it easy to use and integrate into my code. These are really simple, and since I've used them a lot of times before, I can say that I've mastered them.
4. **Variable Declaration** - Compared to C++, JavaScript's variable declaration is way easier, since you don't have to specify what data type would be stored in that variable. It's just let, var or const which are all easy to understand and utilize.
5. **Comparison Operators** - These are also very similar to C++, since the symbols are quite literally the same. The only new thing is that JavaScript has the strict comparison (=== and !==), which also checks the data type. At first, I couldn't understand the "===," but after I did, it was way easier.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.  

1. **Arrays** - This is something I couldn't fully grasp, even last year. I think it's a relatively easy topic, but it's still confusing since I didn't really study much about it. It's even more confusing when it's combined with loops. 
2. **Loops** - For this topic, it's actually quite easy. I can identify which kind of loop to use for a specific problem, but my biggest struggle is nested loops. I still struggle understanding and utilizing nested loops, especially when arrays are included. Actually, I don't really struggle with the body of the loop, like the statements within the inner inner inner loop. What I find challenging are the loop headers—like how do I decide what to declare in the inner loop? How do I make it such that it aligns with the outer loop, and it actually makes sense?
3. **Functions** - Just like arrays, I couldn't fully understand this, even last year. I literally got a zero this year because I didn't understand how they worked (⁠╥⁠﹏⁠╥⁠). I don't know what exactly it is that makes it confusing and challenging, but I just feel like there's a lot going on whenever I see functions.
4. **Debugging** - This is really difficult because the errors don't always exactly tell what / where exactly is wrong, so I gotta be a detective to track down the real issue. It also requires patience since fixing one bug can sometimes create another.
5. **Input** - Inputs are kinda tricky since there are a lot of types that each come with their own rules. I wish we could focus a little more here since it's actually interesting and essential as well.

## Describe what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

One thing I will do is ask my colleagues or friends who are knowledgeable about the topics, especially those that I struggle with the most so that I can get a clearer explanation. I'll also study and do exercises on my own to gauge what I can do and what I need to work on and to actually work on those I need to improve. I'll also set specific schedules on when to do these so that I'll be consistent with it.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think were not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

**Effective:**
1. **The bonus activity for the inverted right triangle** - This was effective since it required critical thinking and actually understanding the code. If you understand the code for the normal right triangle, you just have to add and change some stuff compared to if you really don't know anything. Since I have previous knowledge on this, but it required me to ponder about it, I actually learned something from it.
2. **Graded Exercise 2** - I learned a lot in doing this activity, especially about inputs which is a topic that I struggle with. Even though it's actually easy, as someone who was just starting to learn the topic/language, it was really helpful. It had input, output and even simple math which were the basics of what I needed to learn. It was also fun since this activity is when I started to learn about CSS because I didn't want it to look too plain or too simple.

**Not Effective:**
1. **Graded Exercise 7** - Though it was a good exercise for debugging, it was quite hard. For me, if a topic's too hard, I don't really learn as much. Topics that are too hard make me lose my motivation to actually learn about it.
2. **Graded Exercises 4 and 5** - In contrast to Graded Exercise 7, this exercise was too easy for me. Though it was helpful in refreshing my mind on the topics about conditional statements, I didn't really learn anything else from it.
