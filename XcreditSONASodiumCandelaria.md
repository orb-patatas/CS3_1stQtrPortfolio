**Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason(explaining is optional)**
* A lot were waiting for the topic of online gambling and was really disappointed when it wasn't mentioned  

**Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)**  
    President Marcos’ SONA 2025 showed a mix of 
both sincerity and hope. For the first time, he admitted that many Filipinos were disappointed with how things were going, especially after the midterm elections. He promised to improve basic services like food, education, and utilities. His honesty made the speech feel more serious and focused on results.

However, the SONA also showed the tough path ahead. He carefully talked about the West Philippine Sea without pushing too far, which shows how hard it is to balance diplomacy and defense. While the new social programs sound helpful, many people are unsure if they will actually be implemented and if it’d work. Also, the absence of Vice President Sara Duterte and others made it clear that our political unity is weakening.

**What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?**
We still have hope !
